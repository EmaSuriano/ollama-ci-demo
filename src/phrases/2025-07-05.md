"Roots dig deep, branches stretch wide: Unfold your roots, and let the wind carry your wings." 

This phrase aims to capture the idea of finding strength in stability (roots) while also acknowledging the need for flexibility and expansion (wings). It invites the listener to trust that they will find their unique form and purpose as they journey forward.
